cursor_trail 1

#: Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail"
#: animation. This is an animation that shows a "trail" following the
#: movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large
#: cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor
#: zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls
#: when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds.
#: The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their
#: position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This
#: prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change
#: their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See
#: cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and
#: cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is
#: started.

# cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

#: Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the
#: cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float
#: values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds.
#: The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum),
#: and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time
#: (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the
#: first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor
#: trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail
#: fades away.

# cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

#: Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This
#: option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum
#: number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started.
#: When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is
#: skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.
